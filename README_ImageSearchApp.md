# Image Search App

## 📚 Project Description
This is a personal project developed as part of the **JavaScript Fundamentals** course. It is an interactive image search application that fetches images from the **Pixabay API** and displays them in a dynamic gallery with lightbox previews. The project focuses on practicing API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await), and modern user interface components.
